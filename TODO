Features:
- Keys for moving scrolling around the level (Arrows?).
- Better tab controls: mouse input and list of off-screen tabs.
- Close all tabs button + close all but *this* tab button, etc.
- Ability to reorganise tiles into custom categories, etc.
- Change the scale and spacing of the tile icons for readability

Bug Fixes:
- Fill tool is broken.
- Redoing and history end is broken -- something to do with having a select box present!!!
- Need to test everything!!
- Tooltip word wrapping is broken!

Removals:
- Remove the update notification system (lots of extra code for something not really necessary or stable).
- We can probably remove GLM if we wanted, we really dont't use much of it at all.
