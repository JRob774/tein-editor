Features:
- Keys for moving scrolling around the level (Arrows?).
- Better tab controls: mouse input and list of off-screen tabs.

Bug Fixes:
- ...

Removals:
- Remove the update notification system (lots of extra code for something not really necessary or stable).
- We can probably remove GLM if we wanted, we really dont't use much of it at all.
