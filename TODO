- Keys for scrolling around the level (Arrows?) -- should be configurable by the user
- Better tab controls: mouse input and list of off-screen tabs. (see how this can be implemented with imgui)
- Close all tabs button + close all but *this* tab button, etc.
- Ability to reorganise tiles into custom categories orders, etc. + shrink/hide categories
- Change the scale and spacing of the tile icons for readability (should be user configurable)
- We can probably remove GLM if we wanted, we really dont't use much of it at all
- Preferred over native dialogs? ---> https://github.com/aiekick/ImGuiFileDialog
- Go over all of the tile names and descriptions with someone who knows a lot about modding and tweak/improve/change to make them better
- Add support for different locales
